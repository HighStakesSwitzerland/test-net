## IBC Channels

To enable transfers of the CHT & CGAS token between various cosmos blockchains, Chronic Network Validators will create official IBC channels which will be used for integrations. The channels designated for IBC connections are summarised below:

| <p>host</p><p>project name</p> | <p>host</p><p>chain-id</p> | <p>host </p><p>channel</p> | <p>athena-1</p><p>channel</p> | <p>CHT Token<br>IBC address on host network</p>                     | <p>CGAS Token<br>IBC address on host network</p> 
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | 
| Chronic Network | morocco-1          | channel-2                        | channel-0                   | ibc/TBD | ibc/TBD |
